### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student at Prairie View A&M University majoring in computer science with a minor in math.

I enjoy computer science because it's all about logic and innovation. I enjoy creating projects that can be appreciated and useful to others. I am eager to learn more about Machine Learning, Cyber Security, and Software Engineering. I enjoy working with others and can easily adapt to different environments.

Please don't hesitate to reach out and I look forward to connecting with you!
